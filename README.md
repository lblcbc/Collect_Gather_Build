# ReinforcemenetLearning_Simulation
We build a Actor2Critic model built using Python and Pytorch, where an agent learns to navigate a 6x6 grid with randomly placed resources, collect those resources, and build houses with them - learning to maximise their reward.

## The images below show the final results:
